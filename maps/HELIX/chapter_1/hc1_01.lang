        <Entry Name="Lindwall_4_TalkToLastHuman_3_003_Derek_001">You&apos;re the last human. I just find it disrespectful to our entire history not to fight this. Sure we have the ARK, but you&apos;re the real deal.</Entry>

        <Entry Name="rossdatapad_rossrecording_2_001_rossrecording_001">Since the comet crashed a few days ago -- January 12 -- the WAU has dropped to a low energy state. It hasn&apos;t abandoned its duties. It&apos;s keeping climate and life support going, but it has been simplifying the pattern -- redefining its protocol.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="rossdatapad_rossrecording_3_001_rossrecording_001">The WAU has started to grow physically. It&apos;s not just the core chamber, all around Pathos-II, Structure Gel is bursting through the pipes and bleeding through walls. I don&apos;t know what WAU could possibly stand to gain from this, but I assume it is intentional.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="rossdatapad_rossrecording_4_001_rossrecording_001">The heart of WAU has claimed such a large part of the core chamber that there can no longer be any question to its heightened awareness. Not only does its expansion suggest an unexpected understanding of space, but also its own physical manifestation within the world.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="rossdatapad_rossrecording_5_001_rossrecording_001">The WAU is reaching out to every machine, every life form, to manipulate, to control. It&apos;s trying to help, save its creators from all this, just like the protocol demands. But really, what is good enough?</Entry>
        <Entry Name="rossdatapad_rossrecording_5_002_rossrecording_001">Where is the line drawn for what is human and what is not? Would walking corpses do? Would a group of machines thinking they&apos;re human be acceptable?</Entry>
